If you are seeking feedback on a particular memo, for instance, the insights will catalog who has viewed, how many comments, questions or interactions, etc. It helps to see in real-time, the things staff or clients are excited about and then the items where no one comments.\r\nCataloging of historical information is a real benefit. The dashboard has a notes section where I will keep a lot of private and or personal reflections that I can reference at a later time. I may jot a few notes about a project so I can recall them at a later point. Many programs do this, but again, this is all within the same house and for time and memory sake, this really works well.\r\nSegmenting is very easy to do. We have set up Groups for various projects, teams, clients or cohorts. You can segment as much as you want and one person may be in more than one group but maybe not all groups. Basic segmenting that works well. Notifications are sent when new posts or news is released.\r\nThe platform is not the same portal as Facebook so there is no chance that posts get put on the wrong timeline. With this said, what I like most is the ease of onboarding and no one has had any trouble getting up and going on Workplace. It is like Facebook, easy and something most if not all will have familiarity in navigation.", "cons": "It would be helpful if a review confirmation checkbox was able to be placed by files that needed to be read or reviewed.

It almost looks like a going out of business sale retail store where you notice the empty shelves. Workplace feels a bit bare at times. I think some good design modifications can help.

{"rating": "2.0", "pros": "Great pay, perks, benefits and cool offices. Friendly people (at least on the surface)", "cons": "What I find most annoying and frustrating (found other IC4 or 3 DEs also share the same frustration) are: \r\n1 - The role: Like someone else mentioned I can\u2019t see why we have \u2018engineer\u2019 in our title. It\u2019s like 80% of your day goes about project management, expectation management, navigating team and product priorities, finding work for yourself and just what you need to do next. Then keeping others and yourself updated about what\u2019s going on. When you can get a break from constant meetings and notifications and pings in chat then you can get some work done (Hello overtime). Also put aside time for advertising yourself, writing posts about what great things you are going to do, doing now, and have already done. Add a ton of stress on top of that for delivering IMPACT and constantly wondering if what you are doing is going to create enough noise to get you somewhere.\r\n2 - Lack of well defined projects: you have to put in so much time and energy just to find something to work on. It\u2019s like a manager decides they need some more headcount on their the team and hire the person and then tell them I don\u2019t know what you need to do but there\u2019s something out there for sure, go find out! Good for you if you can find or define a new impactful project, otherwise take on someone else\u2019s work which they abandoned for something with more IMPACT or start working on some product that\u2019s not going anywhere but some vp cares about.\r\n\r\nOther things to consider: \r\n- The role : Data Engineers at FB are in a tough position. Usually noone in other roles really know what you are supposed to do, even DEs themselves will have a bootcamp course to tell them what they are supposed to do. As such you are always in the position of pushing back on requests, trying to define what you should do, or seeking to do the job someone else is already doing but in a better way. If you fail to push back you\u2019ll be flooded with meaningless work (adhoc requests).\r\n\r\nOther cons:\r\n- Lack of Knowledge sharing and documentation: A piece of info you seek could be in a post on workplace, stored on some random quip, a file on dropbox, a sheet on google drive, or some random wiki page. And when you find it you can never trust what you see because it is possibly wrong or already outdated. Better to directly ask someone and hope they have the correct answer to your question. Enjoy waiting for responses or not finding any available time on their calendar to book a meeting.\r\n\r\n-Moving Fast= Tons of junk: Moving fast to deliver short term impact has plagued the analytics org with tons of garbage. Noone cares about optimizing their solutions or documenting their work, and when they get credit for the IMPACT they move on to the next thing.

With the increase in company size over a short span of time, I've notice that there are folks that are hired on that do not align with our mission and values.

{"rating": "1.0", "pros": "Free food, good salary, hype", "cons": "At Facebook I got to know what \"gaslighting\" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you \"why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!\" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told \"I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance\".  This is part of this culture! \r\nThere is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. \r\nPerformance reviews is a complete sham. There is one \"axis\" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. \r\n\r\nCult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal \"non-managers\" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. \r\nHR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. \r\n\r\nWorking at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking.

The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good.

Work/Life Balance\r\nIf you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams.\r\n\r\n2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: \r\n(i) Managers fawning over each other showing \"impact\" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you.\r\n(ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People \"strong arm\" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good.\r\n(iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace.\r\n(iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based\r\n(v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done.\r\n(vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. You are goaled a lot on \"collaboration\" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be \"happy\" and \"always on.\" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system.\r\n\r\n4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's \"XFN this\" and \"XFN that\" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on \"collaboration\" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be \"liked.\"\r\n\r\n5.

The meals provided are of good quality and are free as are the snacks that are provided.", "cons": "(I worked in the Austin, Tx office under the Community Operations organization)\r\n\r\nRampant hostile political atmosphere\r\nTeam leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward.  This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone.  This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions.  No one wins.\r\n\r\nSloppy processes\r\nIt's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes.  Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives).  Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work.  So much waste.  No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.\r\n\r\nNo humanity in the human facing part of the org\r\nWorking in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center.  People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the \"what's in it for me\" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help.  We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.\r\n\r\nCustom everything means sloppy everything\r\nSo many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be!  Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.\r\n\r\nCulture breeds self-absorbed motives within people\r\nFacebook's culture is oriented around \"impact\"- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period.  It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience).  The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook.  It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly.  There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops.  There is only \"What's in it for me?\" \r\n\r\nHRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock\r\nYou never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position).  I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details.  Kind of disappointing. \r\n\r\nMiddle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet\r\nWhen I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place.  But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain.

Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. \r\n\r\nIn general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news.\r\n\r\nWork style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.", "cons": "Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good.  I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!),  split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others.\r\n\r\nAnother minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "12 Sep 2019 - Senior Software Engineer", "authorLocation": "Menlo Park, CA"}

The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render \"natively\" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface \u2014 it was lead by a product designer \u2014 and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money).

The fact that no one internally wanted to move to that team should have alarmed me, but having just moved to FB I didn\u2019t think of leaving that early. Internally, people were very open about how they would rather quit than join our team. I figured that\u2019s the reason why they hired a complete new team, instead of just moving some people around. \n \nHowever, people at FB are generally blinded by the perks and the status of the company.  They make themselves believe that they are happy, but in reality everyone is constantly anxious. They just learn to cope and make it feel normal. \n\nThe pressure is HIGH and the workload tremendous. Because of the amount of silly meetings that you can\u2019t say no to, you will end up spending more than 50 hours per week to make sure you are up to speed. Some people at FB told me that work consumed every second of their life (they just couldn\u2019t switch off). I knew of other colleages that they come in on a Saturday to do some extra work, and some dedicate their Sunday evening on projects to add to their internal CV. \nYou can\u2019t really switch off, at least not before 9PM. So, if you\u2019re in a relationship/have kids, don\u2019t go there. As a single person I felt bad for my colleagues with a family.\n\nIn my situation, and I also speak for the rest of the team, there was no support, no proper internal onboarding and literally no one around to be able to inform you what the general expectations were. It\u2019s all very performance driven, so you have to Build up that amount of work you do, cause everything gets tracked. They don\u2019t care how you do it, just do it. This explains why people work throughout the weekend to make sure they hit a certain amount of finished tasks for that week before the new week starts. You will be compared to Peers on your level, so it\u2019s important to make sure you hit at least average to receive some bonus after your review. \n\nWe had a new manager starting a few months after us, and hierarchy was the management style. Having anything to say went against the manager\u2019s principles and clearly we weren\u2019t liked. So were other colleagues of other teams not liked by this manager, because of their opinions. Be mindful of what you say...not everything is appreciated. \nAt FB, managers are more valued than IC\u2019s and they rather keep a bad manager than a good IC. So please be careful and try to make your manager your friend, trust me it will help you. \n\nThey have amazing trainings on how to manage bias, but in all honesty, everyone was biased. The way they hired people, they way they treated people and the way they rated each other. During the annual performance cycle, you would only ask feedback from the people you had a good relationship with to help you get your bonus. \n\nUp until now, FB was the least favorable experience for me. I only say \u2018worst experience\u2019 when I talk to friends. They saw the negative impact it had on me working in a toxic environment. \n\nI do want to say that 2% genuinely loves working there, unfortunately the majority doesn\u2019t.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "4 Dec 2018 - Talent Acquisition", "authorLocation": "London, England, England"}

Facebook is not growing as fast as it used to, yet the company hires like crazy. To be honest I think this is too much at this point. All these people are doing \"projects\" but these projects are in 3/4 not useful at all. The sole purpose of them is that someone can write it in their performance review but no one really uses the outcome of the project after that. \r\n- Despite the management saying how international the company is, every decision is still taken by Americans/British/Irish and according to their worldview. Which sometimes has awful effects on the company image in countries that were not part of the Commonwealth or are the US. It's particularly visible when there is a PR fire in American or British media, they can change something overnight based on that not thinking about how it will impact other parts of the world. Also it's worth mentioning that a huge majority of managers is Irish/British, and there is little internal mobility for non-natives. \r\n- Performance review is somehow not fair. Technically there are career expectations but if you fulfil all of them, you'll get the lowest score. There are people from certain parts of the world that would be working 16h a day (I'm thinking East Asia in particular) to get the best score so then people from other parts of the world need to work longer as well, otherwise their achievements will look pale compared to those working overtime. And performance assessment, potential promotion and bonus, are based on your place on the curve rather than on whether you fulfilled criteria of your job. \r\n- Internal mobility rules are very unfair. As an external applicant you'd meet and even exceed all the criteria for a particular role but if you are internal you cannot move to a role that is higher grade than yours.

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Instead of completing a formal review, I\u2019ll share a post I made to celebrate my 1 year anniversary since joining Facebook.\n\u2014-\n\nToday marks my first year at Facebook. We call it a Faceversary. And, while celebrating your work \nanniversary might seem a bit frivolous (or at least I thought so early on), I quickly learned to appreciate the FB tradition that\u2019s built around these Faceversaries. It\u2019s valuable to reflect on all that happens in a year at work, considering how much energy, time, and effort we put into it. \n\nWhen you make it to your 10-year milestone (my count down starts now), you get the opportunity to join Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others on the management team to tell a 10-year Faceversary story to the entire company. Those are always funny or emotional, or both. \n \nSo, what can I share after my first year here? \n \nTL;DR: Work with and learn from the very best people. Drinking from the firehose and learning a ton. Autonomy, authority and support. World-class benefits. Open culture to the bones. An inside look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. Five core values in action. Pretty darn happy. \n \nI get the pleasure to work with incredible, impressive, and talented people daily. Both within the walls of Facebook, but also with clients and partners who are working on some unbelievable things. My pod and my core team are just legendary. This isn\u2019t lip service. I really get to work with and learn from the very best. \n \nI\u2019ve learnt SO MUCH. About digital advertising and marketing. About financial services. About media. About other industry verticals I previously knew nothing about. About navigating complex circumstances. About working for a company that\u2019s constantly in the spotlight. About digging deeper to really understand. About cross-functional collaboration. About partnerships. About technology. And much more. Internally, they say every day at Facebook is equivalent to a week. I now know why. \n \nI have the autonomy, authority, and support I need to be successful and run my marketing consulting business the way I see fit. Further, I get to shape and influence how businesses engage, nurture, and build new relationships with people.\n\nI have access to incredible benefits that I\u2019m astonished by daily and so grateful for. In fact, I\u2019m writing this post while on paid paternity leave to spend time with my family and our new addition, Logan. \n \nFacebook fosters an open culture that is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. Mark hosts a weekly company-wide Q&A where he addresses thoughtful and difficult questions about a wide-range of issues and opportunities. Everyone, from Interns to tenured employees, are welcome to ask anything and they don\u2019t face judgement or criticism for raising difficult topics. On our internal Workplace (Facebook for Work), I can join and learn about a whole host of interesting projects, regardless of whether I\u2019m involved in them. \n \nI\u2019ve learnt a lot about both the harmful ways and the incredibly positive ways Facebook can be used. I get a firsthand look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good.\n\nThere are 5 core values that guide how we work at Facebook. And I see them in practice regularly. Build social value. Move fast. Be bold. Be open. Focus on impact. \n \nI\u2019ve always been fortunate in my career. I\u2019ve worked on amazing teams, on fascinating projects, with inspiring mentors and leaders. Facebook has been a continuation of that for me. But, I must say, I\u2019ve never been this happy. \n \nSo, here\u2019s to one amazing year and the many more to follow!", "cons": "The bar has been set so high for any future employer to be within my consideration set.

With the excuse that you should 'focus on impact', people will fight for 'sexy' projects and things that will obtain them a good performance review. Since middle and upper management often do not have a clue about what their own teams actually do, whatever you can make sound important (e.g. with fake metrics or tales of potential impact), you are onto a winner. Unfortunately, the same managers do not enforce a culture of fairness or trust; instead, it is a culture of rewarding back-stabbers and people who 'get the work done' but who, at the same time, treat their colleagues poorly. By that, I mean stealing projects or not giving credit to those who get the work done, for example. It is an awful environment to work in. Some teams are worse than others as well: You could end up reporting into a bad apple who steals projects from you. It happens, and it happens often.\r\n\r\nGood people managers are never rewarded, as people management is not something Facebook recognises as important. Yes, in the orientation they will give you a big speech about it but when was the last time good people managers got promotions? Managers should focus on people, and ICs should focus on things. Unfortunately, bad managers who are good at IC work get rewarded often to the detriment of their teams, who have to suffer under people who should have never become people managers. The so-called Pulse survey is a joke, as no importance is given to low-scoring managers. If 10 people in a team say they would not work with their manager again, something must be wrong, don't you think? \r\n\r\nTo any potential employees: Do not get fooled by the appearances. Facebook makes people feel trapped because they make you think this is the 'best' company and that you should be grateful you are part of Mark Zuckerberg's dream of making the world more 'open and connected'.

I'm given full autonomy to pursue the things that I think are most important. My team is incredibly diverse (including transgender, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino, and an unusually high percentage of women) which shows both an extraordinary commitment to diversity and gives me faith that the product will be built to serve diverse customers. And the backgrounds of the people on my team are shockingly elite, with many projects on their resumes that are immediately familiar to and admired by me.

Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you.

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "From the start, Facebook has been amazing.\r\n\r\nBootcamp was a great experience; not too many companies let a new grad spend 6-8 weeks searching for a good team fit. They let you pick a team, which essentially means you get to pick your tech stack (Backend; Front-end; Mobile; Infrastructure), the org you work for (Messenger, Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, etc.). More importantly, you get to pick your manager + team mates, where as in other large companies, it's the other way around; you are assigned to a product & org  & manager whether you like it or not. This is way different compared to Google's opaque 'host matching' process and Microsoft where they just randomly place you in a division like Azure or Office.\r\n\r\nThe company values really shine through every day. Before Facebook I thought the concept of company values was kind of corny and B.S. Now that I'm at FB I can at least say that here the company values are actually values held by top management + majority of the workforce and not just marketing / HR speak.\r\n\r\nEveryday I really feel like we are moving fast and shipping a lot of product very quickly. We A/B test lots of features, analyze the data, and swiftly decide what to ship to the public. I never feel stuck; I always feel like I'm either implementing an A/B test or analyzing data so we can ship more features. There are not long product cycles with lots of prognostication from product leadership; we build, measure, then learn. Thats it.\r\n\r\nI feel everyday that we have an open culture. At Facebook, we use Workplace, a tool thats kind of like Facebook but for corporations, made by you guessed it... Facebook. Within Workplace, just like normal FB, there are a ton of groups. I'm in a bunch of groups and basically get visibility on decision making + product updates + news from every part of our org. I feel like I'm in the loop and just learn so much about FB / product by reading my Workplace newsfeed. For example, today I read a research report about internet users in India, learned some stuff about dynamic ads, and saw one of the senior leaders announce a new partnership deal. All of that info isn't directly relevant to my day-to-day job, but because its all there and open to anyone, I learn so much and have so much clarity into FB's product vision & company objectives. Mark or Shreyl do Q & A's every Friday. Between hearing top leadership speak, and reading updates from every part of the company on Workplace, I feel that FB is a very open and transparent place to work.\r\n\r\nThere are many other pros and cultural values that I like but let me get to a major pro to end this review. Food!\r\nHere's just a sample from today!  I ate these 3 meals today at the company cafe 2 mins walk away from my desk. \r\n\r\nBreakfast: \r\nSoft Boiled Egg + Been + Cheese + Salsa Tostada. Organic Blueberries & Blackberries. Hemp & Pumpkin seeds.\r\n\r\nLunch:\r\nVegetarian Pho with Sous Vide Eggs, Tofu, Steamed Cabbage, Green Onions, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts in it. Added Sriracha and Chili Oil to spicen it up.\r\nThai Iced Tea Bobba (Bubble) Tea. \r\n\r\nDinner (today was Jamaican themed):\r\nSweet Potato & Corn Casserole, Collared Greens, Fried Plantains, & Quinoa. \r\nI also got a slice of cheese pizza :)\r\n\r\nDessert: Mango Cheesecake made with Graham Cracker Crust. \r\n\r\nBy the way, the menu rotates, and at the HQ, there are a ton of cafes to choose from so way more options for food are there.", "cons": "Work life balance is tough.

From application to job offer, it took 6 weeks. When I got the offer, it was so strong that there as no need to negotiate.  When I got the job and relocated from NY to CA, the relocation package was was so good I didn't have to raise a finger or spend a dime.  Already knew at that point that this company knows how to retain talent.\r\n\r\nThis place truly rewards merit, courage, and being outspoken.  Management is aware enough (at least in my space) to place me in a role that plays to my strengths, and I've enjoyed th freedom to make my role what I want to be.   They are very outspoken when you're performing well and are honest about things that need improvement.  If you have a good idea that is supported by data and aligns well with the goals of your team or whatever your target population may be, you will find resources or people to join you in your efforts.  From hackathons to day-to-day work, this culture permeates every area of the company. \r\n\r\nOne thing that strikes me the most is how strong the diverse community (however small) is within this company.  There are a lot of resources put towards ERG/FBRG efforts, and as a diverse employee, this means A LOT to me.  \r\n\r\nI know the norm is to move around the industry every five years or so, but I don't see myself leaving this company for a long time.

This can result in wasted resources and time since multiple people/small groups coule be working on the same thing without knowing it.

If you want something, whether it be a promotion or a good dessert from the cafeteria, you have to plan how to get it, execute on the plan, and then make sure everyone else knows what you did and how great it was.  You also have to share just enough detail to be convincing but not so much that people can poke holes in your story or usurp your dessert acquisition techniques.\r\n\r\nThe typical first level line manager at Facebook doesn't have prior management experience, only knows the Facebook way of doing things, and is overwhelmed with all the pressure being placed on them.  It's a really hard job, too; your manager will be responsible both for setting the direction of your team and for making sure you and your colleagues grow at the company. Most people are not good at either of those things, let alone both.  Be aware of what your manager is looking for and how to best communicate it.\r\n\r\nEverything FB does is subject to a lot of public scrutiny, and you will know how the sausage is made and see that the goals of the company aren't focused on invading privacy or global domination like everyone else thinks.  It's hard to see this thing that takes up so much of your life lionized and loathed by the press and your friends.\r\n\r\nFor engineers, a lot of the tools you will use day-to-day are incomplete, broken, poorly documented, and might not be supported anymore.  You will get used to this.  \"Move fast and break things\" is more complicated than it sounds, and that's really hard to adapt to when coming from a more traditional company.

Some call them 2nd tier engineers. I call them data peons. They do not get any say in the kind of work they get to do. Any grunt work can be passed on to you and because of the way the review system works, they can screw you if you show any displeasure. An example of this is the data visualizations. The data engineer is expected to do that. I never had to do that before. So you will be spending a lot of time doing housekeeping work like making sure the pipelines run, making sure the font and color choices you made on the dashboards are pleasing to the analysts who sit on top of you in the pecking order. And to add insult to injury, the visualization tool is a home grown one and none of the skills you get from using it are going to help you in a future job i.e. if you plan to continue doing visualizations.\r\n4. Data peons are treated differently as compared to software engineers. Whereas on occasion the software engineers get to work exclusively on different projects for up to a month, there is no such options for data peons. So mobility is very very limited.\r\n5. The performance review system is stacked against data peons. Because they are at the lowest rung, most of the people reviewing them are analysts or above. So the analysts are the overlords even when some of them are absolute idiots. The only ones who can survive in this system are ones with a servile attitude and with mediocre talent and ambition.\r\n\r\nSome of these are because of recent org changes. A lot of the people I know who joined around the same time as me have left the company.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "28 Sep 2016 - ", "authorLocation": ""}

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the \"Pros\" as I see them...\r\n\r\n- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.\r\n- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.\r\n- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.\r\n- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.\r\n- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.\r\n\r\nGranted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.", "cons": "Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.\r\n\r\nBeing able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "16 Feb 2016 - Site Selection Program Manager", "authorLocation": "Menlo Park, CA"}

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "I've been at Facebook for more than six years.  The culture is very introspective and dedicated to self-improvement; if it were the same company it had been in 2009, I wouldn't still be there.  Everytime I think I might leave, a new awesome project comes up that keeps me around.  Seeing Mark Zuckerberg mature into the great leader he is has been magical, and I have a lot of trust in Sheryl and Mark and Mike Schroepfer to make good decisions.  \r\nIn many ways, engineers are more productive now than they were in 2009, despite the fact that we work at a big company now.  We have more tools, resources, and knowledgeable people at our disposal, which compensates to some degree for the increased bureaucracy you see in some parts of the company.  We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value.  Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives.  That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies.\r\nEspecially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up.  You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas.  The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so; management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies.\r\nWhen joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of \"bootcamp\" which means you'll have an informed choice.  It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process.\r\nOne of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work. Another is a recognition that you can advance your career without going into management, and that there are many different kinds of talent.  There are several different \"archetypes\" of senior individual contributors that are recognized and encouraged to flourish.", "cons": "Facebook has become more careful in certain core areas like Newsfeed, Timeline, Ads, and Platform.  There are many stakeholders on these products and thus you've got to get a lot more things buttoned up before you can launch a product change in these core areas.

This lets you expand your skills working on a different set of challenges and stay on your new team when you finish, if you like the work, or head back to your old team to work on something else. The best part is that management encourages these types of moves!\r\n\r\nThe management teams empower you to work on the things you want to, and gives you the ability to impact billions of people. You work on one of the biggest platforms on the planet and you will see the results of the work you put in everyday in making it better.\r\n\r\nAlso, the benefits are pretty amazing.", "cons": "Any complaints seem like extreme first world gripes given all that the company does to keep the employees happy and progressing in their positions and careers, but I do have a few.\r\n\r\nThe company will absolutely (and gladly) take as much time as you put in. They don't overly pressure you to work insane hours, but you will be surrounded by overachievers who put that pressure on themselves and create the perception that large swaths of the company are, \"always working.\" This can be a blessing or curse and it is up to each individual employee to figure out the dreaded work / life balance equation for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe other issue, is that Facebook prides itself on not competing on salary, RSU's, etc. against offers from other companies. While that may seem ok in practice, it results in a revolving door (which is a bit of a Silicon Valley issue in and of itself) between other big tech companies and Facebook. We won't make counteroffers to keep people, but we'll pay them what they wanted before they left to come back which sets a bad precedent for the people who stay.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "4 Jan 2016 - Network Engineer", "authorLocation": "Menlo Park, CA"}

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "- Facebook is very flexible, people are encouraged to work on stuff they're interested in with the best support I've ever seen in industry these years.\r\n- Facebook holds one of the best standards on its benefits - better than all companies with equivalent size.\r\n- People working here are just happier than average industry level, due to this reason you would feel happier too.\r\n- Company momentum is just great, so this could be potentially a place you can stay for a while.\r\n- Great engineers just come from all other companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. College new hires come from top ones: Stanford/MIT/CIT and things.\r\n- Good amount of people here are both smart and diligent, you have many to learn from.\r\n- Although coworkers are competitive here, they are much nicer to work with than other companies holding same 'elite principals'. For example, I rarely see (though there're few) arrogant people here. The whole culture was built in the sense to favor people who are both smart and humble.\r\n- Culture encourages transparency, so you have to learn hear and accept sometimes very tough feedbacks, but you could end up growing much faster as you can tell.\r\n- If you are good, there's no barrier on 'what you can do'. Facebook does NOT reveal your level to anyone else except your report. So you could see E3 engineers work like E4 or even E5 in the end. But in another way around, it could be tough for seniors.\r\n- Facebook sees deliveries (executions) as 1st priority, so people here just focus on work more than the rest, I believe this is one of the biggest reasons why this company moves faster than other companies with equivalent size.\r\n- Most of work in Facebook reaches great amount of people (1.5B in web, 1.3B in mobile), and great amount of revenue (20B of this year). So you can tell how much impact you can have, and this would to the minimum becomes a highlighting bullet point on your resume.\r\n- People says Facebook has bad work/life balance, I don't agree: 1) you have freedom to pick a laid-back team and free to go almost anytime (they have hackamonth program and it is true), 2) most of time I see hardworking people working hard due to their own choice.", "cons": "- People says Facebook has less politics, but I do feel some.

This product serves over 1.5 billion people - it is the most exciting product to be part of.\r\n\r\nIs the Problem interesting? Beyond interesting. We're trying to solve making the entire world more open and connected through communication, through sharing, through education, etc... In any area of the company, the problems are all great problems to solve.\r\n\r\nWhat about the People? The people are literally the best people I've ever worked with in any position I've been through. They are brilliant, kind, friendly and completely supportive. I left my last company as a senior member and at Facebook, I still feel like I'm learning something new from my colleagues every single day. Beyond my colleagues, the leadership here are more than supportive about an individual's career growth to help us grow deep within our roles, support groups to help you become a better manager, classes to help individuals transition from one career to another. I've seen many of my colleagues get the opportunity to completely change paths (e.g. Designer to Engineer, Researcher to Designer, Designer to PM, etc). You pave your own path and leadership here is supportive to help you get to where you want to be.\r\n\r\nSo what about Profit? Facebook, luckily, is doing very well in this area. At a personal level, Facebook pays also very well. I was lucky enough to have my total acquisition package matched and exceeded which made saying yes to Facebook a no brainer.\r\n\r\nTake a great product, great people, amazing culture and a beautiful place to work and tie that all up in a bow.

The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do.  \r\n\r\n-Unbelievable benefits and compensation.  Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing.  Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a \"baby bonus\"), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on.  \r\n- Strong company culture and values.  I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely.  Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, \"Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?\".  Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident; there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the \"#shiplove\" mantra is strong here.\r\n-Work/life balance.  You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here.  I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends.\r\n-Facilities.  It's Facebook!  The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors.  Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk.\r\n-Efficient and fast.  Fewer politics than many other companies of this size.  A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system.\r\n-The future!  These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff.  Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool.\r\n-Women's leadership.  I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams).  They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a \"Managing Bias\" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering.  They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most.", "cons": "-Entitlement.

Facebook truly believes in making the world more open and connected; including those people who aren't even online yet. Every role and department ladders back to that. \r\n\r\nIn advertising sales, we have the goal of building our client's businesses by connecting them to the consumers who matter to them. More importantly, we ensure that people on Facebook are seeing ads that are relevant and high quality, this delivers shared value both for the advertiser and the end person using our products. We also have proven and measurable results across verticals, which drives continued client interest and adoption. \r\n\r\nHaving come from another founder led company, Mark is incredibly brilliant, open, honest and hard working. He surrounds himself with fantastic people, listens carefully, cares about the people who work for him, and makes long view decisions for the health of the company. \r\n\r\nManagement and the people who work at Facebook follow leadership's example, everyone rolls up their sleeves to get the work done, and is incredibly grateful to be here. \r\n\r\nAs a woman it's also inspiring and impactful to have female leadership at all levels, and colleagues who are incredibly encouraging. I personally experienced this when a male peer encouraged me to apply for a management position on our team.

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:\r\n\r\n1. The real impact\r\nAt Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.\r\n\r\nIn Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.\r\n\r\nThen I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.\r\n\r\n2. The organizational structure\r\nGoogle's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.", "cons": "1. I don't quite like the office decoration style.

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a \"need to know\" basis, etc. \r\n\r\nThis culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.\r\n\r\nIt's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.\r\n\r\nOne cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.\r\n\r\nThey have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.\r\n\r\nThe perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.\r\n\r\nOf course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.\r\n\r\nYou'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.\r\n\r\nFB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.\r\n\r\nWork-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.\r\n\r\nThe best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.", "cons": "FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.\r\n\r\nFB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and \"get with the program\" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point.

Similar to other organizations, there are two primary types of sellers (Account Managers & Account Executives) at Facebook these roles are basically the same with different titles and pay scales.\r\n*As a seller, you are not properly incentivized to go above & beyond what is expected of you, in many cases if you exceed you're goal it actually hurts your compensation for the future due to the disproportionate weight your achievement is given for the future.

We have a well documented belief in openness, and cutting through red tape to do whats best for the organization.  At the end of the day, the sales organization does not feel like like it is held to the same standard.  People feel like they have to walk on eggshells about what kind of feedback they provide to their managers or management in general, favoritism from mid level managers to the director level runs rampant - know how to play the game.  Often times decisions feel like they have been made based on what is good for a particular individual (what will make them look good to their own manager) versus what is best for the company and from this view point it appears that it pays off for those people who think of themselves before the company.

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Facebook has incredible camaraderie as well as benefits.  Everyone is friends here, we work hard, but also have a great time and love coming to work every day.  We get free gourmet breakfast, lunch and dinner daily from an amazing culinary team.  We play basketball every week, have free beer on Friday and get to ripstick around the office.  We even have games rooms and a ping pong table! The people who work here are incredibly high caliber individuals.  The recruiting process is tough!", "cons": "Some of the younger folks here (and there are many) have never worked anywhere else and they have no idea how good the place is.  This often leads to a sense of entitlement which would never fly at another Company.  Having said that, we all benefit from the extra perks that get put in place.

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "* Incredibly smart and intensely motivated peers.\r\n* Immense opportunity. There a ton of growth and a lot of things that can be done. People with initiative do really well here.\r\n* The world sees the impact of what you're working on. All my friends and family use the product and it's rewarding to work on something that keeps us all connected.\r\n* Amazing food. We get breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner served up by the best chefs around. Menus change daily and my favorite to date has been the Willy Wonka themed lunch menu. Sushi day is legit too.\r\n* Flexible work schedules. 9 to 5 is dead, work the times that best work for you and your job.\r\n* Fun (Game Day, random toga party, RipStiks, cool people, etc.)", "cons": "There's some growing pains because of the fast company growth and the office can get a bit noisy at times.

{"rating": "4.0", "pros": "Although hours a bit long and it takes much time for me to commute from home to office, other things that Facebook offers all make me love this place - salary, bonus, not to mention the excellent benefits. It is also both satisfying and challenging to work with very smart colleagues. The people are young, passionate, and intelligent. The culture is very open internally were projects are discussed and ideas flow. They have amazing R+D and projects happening all the time, because people dare to dream, pursue challenges, and are generally incentivized to be innovative", "cons": "Facebook  is not a hot start-up that it used to be.

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "Everyone talks about the free food, fun environment, etc but I definitely think the most valued benefit to working at facebook is the ability to basically set your own hours, freedom to work from home when you want and as much as you want/can, and all this with little to no interference from management.  It's just great to know that if you're not feeling well but not necessarily \"too sick to work\" you can stay home and work (they provide laptops)....oh and...sick days are not counted against your vacation if you really needed to take a real sick day anyhow.", "cons": "Because of the work from home policy, you do find yourself basically working all the time in a way.  Some say it's a downside, I personally loved it!  As long as I got my work done my boss didn't care how much I was actually in the office.  However, I do have to say, that I did NOT abuse this.  I really only worked from home when I absolutely needed to.
