Management seems to be blinded by them.", "cons": "-There are a lot of conflicts with other branches of JnJ. Colleagues outside the branch and contractors are sometimes kept in the dark about their status. \r\n\r\n-Office politics are everywhere. Hypocrites talk jives, goof around and take other's credit, but the management trusts them. Promotions aren't based on merits. Who attends training or conferences is base on how friendly you are with your manager, not skill needs. A lot of secret meetings behind your back, as well as gossiping and trash-talking; it is not an environment for earnest people who just want to work. After a certain time, an employee would either have to play the same game (I witnessed decent people turning like that over time in this toxic environment) or be targeted, bullied, have their merits stolen and eventually pushed out. It may be the right place to learn to play politics. Real talents wouldn't stay long.\r\n\r\n-There is very little guidance and mentoring for junior employees; Low tolerance for learning curves. Junior developers are questioned on their abilities if they spend a bit longer to onboard. On the opposite, some particular \"senior\" developers really take their time learning on the projects or are never eager to improve.  With the name of \"Pair Programming\", they can simpliy cover the truth about their real level. It also happened once or twice junior team members were jeered during so called \"Pair Programming\".  \r\n\r\n-Even though JnJ has a good company culture, the development centre\u2019s culture is mediocre. Despite the emphasis on diversity and inclusion, it is hard to progress if you are a not a white male. It is not surprising to hear jokes on one's ethnicity, background, accent, politic views, etc. The recruitment process is opaque. Overall, there is a clear difference in treatment between white and non-white, especially Asians. \r\n\r\n-Performance reviews and goal settings are a bit confusing, and in the end, it depends again on your relationship with whoever review you.\r\n\r\n-As a young female junior employee, I was harassed by a senior member for several years and bullied by his allies. My mentor (a white male) only asked me to resolve it myself and encouraged me not to speak up. When I finally decided to speak up, my mentor turned against me and revealed himself to be also part of the problem. I spent lots of time and money on mental counselling and therapy. \r\n\r\nConclusion: my time at here was harrowing and exhausting. I ended up with serious depression problems.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "1 Jun 2020 - Junior Software Engineer", "authorLocation": "Limerick, Limerick, Limerick"}

Once you reach Director-level, you are looking at a base plus a 20-30% bonus based on performance - can't beat a meritocracy. Long-term incentive plan is realistic and will remain in place: percentage of base salary in Restricted Stock Units that mature in 3 years - that is, you take approx 20% of your base salary divide it by the trailing 30-day average stock price to arrive at a number of SHARES of stock, not stock options. Take this year's number of shares of J&J stock and you can sell them in 3 years - that is a rolling plan of stock ownership until you retire - that's better than a pension plan if you take your long-term incentive money and invest it conservatively instead of spending it. Management at the Corporate Level and at the Operating Company level have been the best in the healthcare industry...for as long as anyone can remember. If you don't like your micro-environment, i.e. your current job function and supervisor, you can bid on internal jobs in over 20 divisions that gross over $1b top-line sales. Diversify the functional areas as you gain tenure and you will have your choice of industry-leading businesses to work in --- just stay patient for the right opening.

As listed in Pros, J&J IRDP is great in many ways but has lots of issues in the long term. IRDP is a global initiative where they encourage local subsidiaries to hire MBAs. J&J has few MBAs internally so they need to hire MBAs to make J&J look good in annual reports. However, J&J is a sales driven company and almost all senior managers in local subsidiaries started as medical sales reps and then made their way up. Some of them don't even have college degrees but have decades of J&J experience. These old timers don't believe in this whole IRDP practice and IRDPs are always seen as outsiders within their organizations. When MBAs are hired, there is almost always no mention of necessity of sales experience but in couple of years, they are asked to work as a sales rep and then make their way up like reps. It is like J&J saying that your MBA and great work experience means nothing to us and you will have to start in sales from the same level as some nurse who just moved into medical sales. Sales experience is important but it can be given in short assignments instead of expecting MBAs to spend 3-4 years in field sales. Most IRDPs leave the organization at this stage (between 2 to 3 years of joining the company) and it is very rare for an IRDP to make it to general management. In my organization, only one guy made it to a GM from over 80 IRDPs hired in 10 years time-frame.\r\n\r\nJ&J is a great company to work for if you intend to work there for life. Great benefits and good culture but certainly not for MBAs. If you want to take life easy, work for J&J and lifetime employment is guaranteed even if worked 10% of your MBA potential but expect to spend 10 years as a Product Manager and then a few years in sales before you move into senior roles.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "24 Feb 2012 - IRDP (International Recruitment Development Program)", "authorLocation": ""}

I am very proud to have worked with J&J, but I'm disappointed in their current direction.  J&J has moved away from its decentralized model, and they've done a poor job of promoting/retaining their best people.  \r\n\r\nMy initial experience was excellent.  We were acquired by J&J.  They left us alone, and they provided the finanical capacity for us to make some investments that we could not have accomplished on our own.  Then growth slowed at other J&J companies, and J&J began to restructure.  Longtime J&J employees began getting hired at our company.  In fact, our management was told that they needed to find positions for many of them.  The old J&J people then brought their friends with them.  The problem with this is that the J&J people didn't understand our business.  The decision making process became over-complicated and confusing.  One external consultant warned our team that J&J paralyzes itself with analysis.  \r\n\r\nJ&J became a very tough place to work.  New jobs were posted that weren't really available... they had already been promised to someone else.  The J&J people in managment filled their teams with people they knew regardless of whether the person was competent for the position.  I asked one of my peers (a longtime J&J guy) why he hired one of his district managers.  I had interviewed her (at the request of the national sales director) and I found her to be incompetent.  I didn't know him very well but he said she would do a great job.  She was a disaster and so was he.  They both finished dead last in the national sales standings, and the morale on their teams was completely destroyed.  Despite how terrible she was, they promoted her back in house.  Her boss blamed the sales team.  I knew several members of the sales team... they were not the problem.  Even the district manager's former sales colleagues said they knew she would be a disaster.  Both she and her former boss are still with J&J.  There is no accountability.\r\n\r\nI was truly sad to leave the company.  J&J has some truly outstanding products.  It is a leader in healthcare, and they are very supportive of their communities.  However, they've protected bad subsidiary managers for too long, and these people have surrounded themselves with equally bad people.\r\n\r\nBefore I left, I tried an experiment.  I stopped doing any work, and I just spent my time in meetings and networking.  To my surprise, I was offered several new jobs.  I wasn't even qualified for one of them, but the VP wanted someone he knew.  I will admit it was tempting, but I couldn't do it.\r\n\r\nI'm told J&J monitors these boards, so I'm sure they'll put a black mark on my HR file for writing this.  I truly hope the company changes.

Often times it doesn't matter how good you are at sales it will come down to whether your drug is on formulary or not and if the office/physician likes you or not so building a super strong relationship with your offices is critical to your success.  This industry is still not stable in terms of a sales career.  Patent Cliffs come fast and if you are a me too drug meaning third in line or further down - forget it...

When the inner circle decides that they don't like you, they will find a way to get rid of you.\r\n\r\nNot Organized: This group is in its awkward teenage years of development, so there are not a lot of established procedures and processes.  There is a lot of hurry up and wait with projects.   Some work can feel like busy work, and it is not clear what the outcome is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nNepotism:  Most people in the office are connected with their co-workers in some way (friends, old classmates, neighbors, etc.).  If you are not it the inner circle, you may be treated differently.

They pay well above market because they have to to keep people.

Impossibly short time lines for product design and testing are the norm and if there is a slip, jobs are at risk. Employees there understand this so they will cut corners and find creative ways to rationalize poor technical plans and decisions to meet time like. This is fundamentally a marketing controlled company with their biggest asset being their brand. I predict in the next 10 years, this company will become more of a brand label like Westinghouse or RCA, where their power comes from licensing the brand to other less known names.

The department I worked in, people were routinely getting sick with ulcers and other GI troubles due to work stress.  Management has a very snoby attitude to employees. It is do as they tell you now or you will be out in the next round of layoffs which seems to always be less than 1 year away.
