I work in BlackRock Solutions and have been involved with expanding Aladdin's capabilities my entire career in different ways.

It really is a \"One BlackRock\" mentality which comes from the top from Larry and Rob K. 15 years has gone by quickly and the work tends to get better and more fun as you progress, since you get deeper in your areas of expertise, build your network of friends and colleagues, and are able to grow impact and ability to affect change.", "cons": "Being a large company that has been doing technology for 30+ years, we're not the fastest moving in terms of adopting/deploying the latest tech.

Slightly outdated and high-level at times, but sufficiently detailed enough to be very well-informed about any process you want to learn about.\r\n\r\n> People are approachable - no matter the rank - and are willing to spend 30 minutes to explain things to you (as long as you are asking questions relevant to their rank - no point asking about technical stuff with a MD!)\r\n\r\n> Management dares to make declarations and guarantees, and they take care of their staff - e.g. during the handling of COVID, they made multiple declarations - one where that no one would be fired until end of 2020 (barring performance issues), and another that there will be no compulsion AT ALL to return to office if we are uncomfortable doing so. Loved it when they did that.", "cons": "> 5-point rating system - where \"Strongly Performed\" is the center rating, and there are 2 more ratings above - \"Outperformed\" and \"Strongly Outperformed\". Makes people who perform strongly, feel average. Of course, it could be argued that it drives strong staff to work even harder (as there are 2 more grades to \"attain\"). Or perhaps its similar to \"tall... and taller\" when referring to short and tall people. My take is that \"Outperformed\" should already indicate a potential promotion candidate -- and \"Strongly Outperformed\" should not exist - as these people should already have been promoted (i.e. the concept of outperforming an outperformer feels... weird)?\r\n\r\n> Very specialist roles / high demands even at Analyst / Associate levels leading to low mobility at those levels - an \"Associate\" would already be expected to know all related technical & financial knowledge regarding the process (and 30-40% of people having 5-10 years experience) - at a minimum, people need to be a VP to even consider mobility into another team to learn something different. Changing teams would literally be resetting the clock (as you would not have the knowledge). Also, imagine trying to compete with people with 5-10yrs experience for promotion... even if you have the same no. of years, you'd just be on par. You'd need very special reasons / projects to get ahead - and not many of these are available due to the highly specialized teams (which mainly focus on their part of the process).\r\n\r\n> Although availability of knowledge is listed as a \"Pro\" above, in terms of working-level knowledge, these are recorded in procedure documents that are confusing to the new joiner, or not recorded at all. Although the process I am in is highly variable in terms of its product / country mix and the steps are very granular, the same products / countries are generally handled through the same checking points / steps (and should be listed down lest a detail is missed and downstream impacts occur).", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "7 Jan 2021 - Vice President", "authorLocation": "Singapore"}

Every client issue is a matter of life and death, and they will make you work day and night until the seemingly so important issue is resolved. And then once you do resolve the issue, you will get no thanks from them,they will just move onto the next \"urgent\" issue. They put the client first and not their employees, which makes for a very toxic environment. Not to mention, these individuals walk around acting as though they are working on the cure for cancer or something else super important. \r\n\r\nThere is no culture and the employee / manger relationship is non existent, you are just made to work as though its a sweatshop. There is no recognition for any work you do, or any of your achievements. The only reward you get is more work to be completed, and you will be called on the weekend if anything goes wrong. \r\n\r\nThere is a zero work life balance, look forward to being on call for about 24 hours a day, because half the people at the firm are barely competent enough to get dressed in the morning, let alone resolve any issues on their own.

{"rating": "5.0", "pros": "You learn A LOT starting on day one. You can go as far as you want and hard work is recognized. The greatest motivation is the outstanding and committed people around you who have ownership mentality. BlackRock is an enigma. Its a very large company with very few meetings, having only 6 in almost 3 years,very few formal processes but for some reason everyone knows what to do: understanding clients, shareholders and management demands. Nobody tells you what to do but they are very clear on what they expect. If you hate long boring meetings, loathe useless conversations and desire direct access to management, this is the place for you. \r\n\r\nThe secret to BlackRock is their people. They look beyond education and grades (which still are still important) to character, commitment and willingness to learn things outside the comfort zone. You will see liberal arts majors writing code and SQL while computer science majors do their CFA.  Its a very good dynamic, connecting business and engineering.  I told a director in my interview: \"I don't know what you have in mind for me but whatever it is, for every dollar you invest (in me), you will get three back by the end of the year!\". He replied, \"I like confidence!\".   I was interviewing at GE to be a sourcing manager at the same time. I chose BlackRock, not really understanding the role, but rather on the energy.  \r\n\r\nI even met Charlie Hallac after my 2nd week. The company #3 knew who I was, calling out a few points on my CV during our impromptu conversation. BlackRock MD's and executives see everything from afar like Odin sees the world through his ravens. I received several emails from MDs and executives, thanking me when I stayed up late doing extra QC on days with large market movements.\r\n\r\nThe colleagues helpfulness depends on who you ask. If you persist, you can get help. I even learned to code by bothering and annoying my colleagues on a regular basis.  If you smile and show a lot of energy, even the most grumpy give in, teaching you something.  There is no formal training process. On day one, you are given a black notebook and a pen. Then its baptism by fire. Its very important to write everything down because they remember what they told you, getting very upset if they have to repeat themselves.  People yell at you, a lot, but its ok. It is part of the learning process and gives you good war stories later.  The first 6 months, you feel lost but then things start to click, so hang in there.\r\n\r\nHard work at BLK does not go unnoticed. The experience and long hours paid off with a position 2-3 levels higher in another company. As a director at the new job with hiring responsibility, the first thing I did was search out my former colleagues with the goal of replicating this culture.", "cons": "I started this job at 39 years of age.  Keeping up with aggressive young people with high IQ's, good breeding and raw ambition wears you out.   The hours are very long, but this is necessary to learn the job. The job is also addictive. No one tells you to stay late, you sort of do this on your own, losing track of time because the work is actually interesting and you feel needed. This pays off. Having BlackRock on your CV can land you a very good job anywhere in the world. It takes a few years after you left to understand this.

The firm has only been in existence for 25 years so it's free from the stuffiness of older firms where there is an unwillingness to try new things due to an established way of doing things over the years. The firm has been through numerous mergers and aqcuisitions which in itself has created a very open-minded culture overall.

In general, people are not really given incentive to do their jobs well. Good performance is rarely rewarded, bad performance is rarely punished.

If you engage a random employee in a 1on1 deep conversation, and show that it is okay to be actually honest, and you ask about how they feel about BlackRock, they often will end complaining for an extended period of time, and say that this is just a stepping stone for them, a good place to learn, but they don't think of staying here long term.  In fact, how much people believe that BlackRock is a great place is strongly correlated to how much they have to sell that \"BlackRock is a great place\" to others. HR who has to sell the firm to possible hires, or client facing teams might be overly positive, but isolated teams like FMG might be overly negative about it.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTech solutions aren\u2019t too cutting edge. Most of the tech solutions here are rather deprecated. There are codebases in such shape, that most of the people agree that only a complete rewrite could save them. You sometimes better off reimplementing something than using the previous work of another BlackRock employee. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tTeams are organized in an ineffective way. The HR of BlackRock really believes that diversity makes better teams. The employees of BlackRock actually like to make fun of how much it does not work, and how most of the people dislike working in such teams.\r\nBut diversity here also implies that teams are usually spread across multiple locations - often with huge time zone difference, making even more difficulties in teamwork.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPlanning for the future is undervalued. The management only have supper vague plans for the future, that are not detailed enough for practical use. Even for current projects, there are often no specifications or detailed plans.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHigh turnover. Most of the BlackRock employees leave after a few years.

There are managers who have been here for more than 10 years, and there are juniors who joined in the past 3 years, but there's not much people in between.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe talent pool is not that exceptional.

Presuming it's sustained over the long-term, I think it will work.  Feels like it's a genuine effort, and in a lot of ways the firm has great roots to build from.  There's a lot of pride from legacy BGI and legacy BlackRock employees - in some cases that leads to conflicts, but also has the potential to lead to great things if the cultures can be reconciled to capture the best of both legacy cultures.  In San Francisco, I feel that there's an overall positive vibe.  BGI-ers felt a connection to the firm, and the passion showed as a result.

There's been a lot of focus on improving many things, but a few things seem to stand out as yet unresolved problems.  One is technology and resourcing, which both continue to be constant struggles.  Another (and often related) is that decision making is still centralized among very few people at the top.  And as part of that, there's also a bit of a bravado culture at the top, and decisions can often be made based on someone escalating to someone higher up and gaining their alignment, rather than on the merits, which I think is unfortunate.  To be fair, I think that some of the cost management is actually a function of good management control over costs (there's waste at BlackRock, just as there is in any firm).  The problem is that there aren't great mechanisms to recognize which parts of the business run very lean and responsibly, versus those that don't, and that can cause frustration...and worse, gridlock at times.

SF is a satellite office, even though there is superior technical talent.  Management will tell you otherwise, but that is how it is.\r\n2) Your experience will largely depend on what group you are in and where your group is located.  If you work in SF, be part of an SF-based group.  Many groups are remote, resulting in lots of phone calls.  What could be accomplished in minutes takes hours.\r\n3) Most MDs are in NY, so you get limited face-time if you are working on the west coast.  They generally don't know what you are working on and what skills you bring to the table.  If you can sit with them in their office, you have a huge advantage (i.e., if you are located on the east coast).\r\n4) Career growth is limited.  Promotions are based on your relationship with your MD (and your manager), not technical skill.  I've seen tech people with years of schooling and experience stagnate, while biz people with soft skills (i.e., anyone could pick up at work) get promoted.  Although the company prides itself on being technology-oriented, technical people are second-class citizens.  Any biz school grad with the same skills/knowledge/drive as a tech grad will be 1-2 steps ahead in the hierarchy.\r\n5) Speed is rewarded over quality.  New projects pop up continually and are pushed out without spending the proper time designing solutions.  Technical debt is knee-deep.\r\n6) Project management is seriously lacking.

{"rating": "1.0", "pros": "Financial company, good list of clients", "cons": "I had a very bad experience working with BlackRock Inc.. I was a high-ranking student with 3.9 GPA from a premier Technology university in upstate New York with over 4 years of prior full-time software development experience in IT industry. I have several project star awards to my credit prior to working with this company. At BlackRock, I was hired as an Analyst with an inaccurate software engineer job description out of my university by my manager in Green Package Automation team - Portfolio Analytics Group only to realize that they could not find young graduates to fill in their requisitions and people who had left, and hence they did not disclose the truth! Yes, believe me they do manipulate job description and wages when hiring you.\r\n\r\nI was based out of Wilmington, Delaware and the work culture is a bad shape! Cheap, unqualified professionals, low wages, intensely bureaucratic software release process, work times being tracked, your computer screen is being stalked, your conversations are being stalked, etc. Little or no good mentors available since even they are fighting/competing with the company culture by leaking your performance and minor mistakes to your manager to gain credit for being watchful seniors.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Software Engineer or Technology-related professional this company will not be a good move! The management has only bad apples left since the good ones have left. Managers have been promoted not by virtue of technology knowledge or innovation but since they stayed back when others left leaving no competition for them. You are assigned work on Angular, Angular UI, Node.js, jQuery, JavaScript but my manager did not have first-hand experience/competence on the same. Till date they keep writing and maintain Perl scripts and have recently started building web applications internally. Totally unstructured process of developing process, literally no unit-test cases written, or full-time tester testing your developed software but aiming for 'whatever you've done will work when released'! They do not understand or implement Agile software development methodology and use JIRA as a substitute assuming that by itself is Agile methodology. Absence of a process means believing in incorrect estimations of work and blaming that on your team members in year-end review.\r\n\r\nTo correct the decade-old bad software left behind by employees who have left, rewriting and reinventing software is not possible since moving a brick will cause business to be disrupted and I've tried earnestly and my manager watched silently to blame me for my efforts. Problem-solving and design-thinking (the very core tenet of software engineering) is non-existent! Following such a practice for a year only makes you a bad engineer and develops an attitude of complacency and incompetence (with correct practices).\r\n\r\nApplying Organizational Behavior, I could notice employees working too many extra hours (both on weekdays and on weekends). Male employees with grey hair at the age of 25 and several others going bald at an age of 28-30 due to over-working, fighting frustration and bad mental health. I had noticed employees having an accident/surgery and showing up to work (on sometimes crutches) next day. Workload management and Empathy was missing! I had to hide my happiness and minor accomplishments from my own team and manager.\r\n\r\nYour year-end review will be frustrating and a big let down in your overall career because your will be evaluated against goals/job description you did not set! You only realize the bad experience in the job after being deep down in the bad shape and how bad an engineer you had become after you make a good move (i.e. find a good job) and become a good competitive engineer again, and earn a promotion with fair and spirited team culture and mentors. \r\n\r\nRest you go figure.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "26 Feb 2017 - Analyst", "authorLocation": "Wilmington, DE"}

You won't be for long.  \r\n\r\n- if you want any type of work life balance rethink your idea to join this firm.  It's very difficult to leave at end of day without being viewed as a slacker (even if it's been a 12 hr day for you), much less to leave the office for a dr appointment,  child school event, looking for an apartment, running an errand at lunch - all impossible.  \r\n\r\n- during my time there I never met anyone who was \"happy\" or \"satisfied\".  Moral is low as staff is so overworked.  As a result of current job market - many remain longer than they want due to lack of alternative opportunities.  \r\n\r\n- transfers b/w departments (regardless of your role) was rarely successful or beneficial to both parties.  Mostly used as an exit ramp for the employee.  \r\n\r\n- management levels are thick and multiple.\r\n\r\n- re-creation of the wheel is a weekly process.  \r\n\r\n- the infrastructure of the firm has not grown with the firm in order to now support 5000+ employees\r\n\r\n- many simple transactions take a long time due to multiple layers of mngt and lack of up to date infrastructure\r\n\r\n- senior management does not treat their direct staff well.

Management & HR does little to off load these staffers.   \r\n\r\n- compensation was just above average.  Bonus discussions went like this w/ managers \"I have your comp number here but before we discuss that let's talk about what I need from you going forward\" - insert project laundry list of huge tasks you'll now have to incorporate into your already overloaded plate.  \r\n\r\n- once you decided to leave the firm and resign you'll be publicly labeled a \"non-performer\" by management (regardless of your tenure or performance).

Technical leadership across the firm is conspicuously absent. The level of institutional arrogance is high, and few external hires have had success.\r\n \r\nThe culture is very top-down. BlackRock has a habit of hiring experts and then telling them what to do. This culture, combined with individually-driven bonuses, lack of effective engineering structure or (any) process results in extreme siloing and lots of bad behavior. There's little product vision beyond implementing more features. There's a complete lack of proper estimation or teamwork. Resources are not allocated appropriately or in a dedicated fashion. \u2028\u2028\r\n\r\nConsistent large turnover in engineering. The cycle of doom is alive and well: over promise, under deliver, deadlines missed, trust destroyed, and total demoralization. Rinse, wash, repeat.\r\n\r\nThink twice before you accept a role at this company.", "adviceManagement": "", "authorInfo": "17 Mar 2017 - Anonymous Employee", "authorLocation": ""}
