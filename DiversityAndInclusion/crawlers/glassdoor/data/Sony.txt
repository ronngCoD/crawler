{"rating": "1.0", "pros": "If you are a wash-out and have no other employment prospects with a true reputable company, pros for you would include:\r\n\r\nGreat work-life balance! Unless you live in anywhere near Dubai or in Sharjah, then expect a (roughly) 2 hour commute ONE WAY in the company bus. Their HQ is halfway to Abu Dhabi. No need to stay and work late, unless your boss is working late too. Show your dedication to work, stay on doing nothing for no overtime. Oh, and if you have a car, be prepared to be told they have no space in the lot (all reserved for the bigwigs) and wont take responsibility for any muck-ups that may happen on premises.\r\n\r\nFree Lunch! Oily, unhealthy, tasteless food, dirty pantry and lack of choice.  Great way to stay in touch with your Doctor. If you don't want it, no problem! Ask them to not give you lunch and bump up your salary in lieu of, and let us all know if you succeed.\r\n\r\nMulticultural environment! Yes, among the sea of Indians and Filipinos, you may spot the odd Arab or Pakistani, except ofcourse for the HODs who are mostly all Japanese and don't socialise much. Also, employees love spending time at work to cater to everyone's religious festivals; I mean why not? You're expected to stay on late anyway, might as well dance around and put on a couple of skits. Employee Engagement at the cost of a family life or time at the gym, you'd be stuck in traffic anyway, yay!\r\n\r\nCareer Progression! Haven't received an education above a bachelors from an unheard of university? Haven't stayed up to date and relevant in your chosen field? Cant get ahead anywhere else? Got 5 years to spare to move up? Come on over!\r\n\r\nEmployee discount! Learn about the tiny margins and then jump through hoops and red-tape; this comes naturally if you're used to working in the failing government entities or 'developing nations'. Be grateful you're getting anything at all!\r\n\r\nSimple! Yes, no need to use your experience, education, wits or industry know-how, just do what they tell you to do and no need for any inputs. I mean hey, surely these guys are still number one for a reason right? They haven't slipped at all in terms of product, R&D, marketing at all right? Right?\r\n\r\nLong term vision! The Heads keep rotating every 3-4 years and so are only concerned with their immediate results, who cares about long term goals or presence? That's a great strategy, let's keep everyone as happy as possible for now, let the other guys figure out the issues when they crop up, I certainly won't be around.\r\n\r\nPay and benefits! Haven't you heard? They're the best! You'll get the lowdown when you join and learn about the Compa-ratio. Be grateful, you get free lunch, company transport, 'employee engagement', and other things which SOUND great...if you haven't worked at a proper MNC or first rate firm before.", "cons": "No cons....except that you will meet some really great people who will  leave before the year is out when they realise that all the Pros above don't really work out for high-performance people with two brain cells and good industry experience. Don't believe me? Do a LinkedIn search for yourself. I should have done it and saved myself the headache of working for a great company ruined by sub-par people who couldn't jump ship because no one else would take them.\r\n\r\nSimple coworkers! No drama as all the ones that have stayed are such lovely, docile, gentle folk. Busy lil worker bees all buzzing about to get a job done like drones. If you're lucky some will actually tell you truth and how they feel, but most are happy to live risk-free work lives and not make an actual effort to contribute to making the place better. Sheeple.\r\n\r\nThey say that age and where your passport are from don't matter; the pattern would suggest other wise, but hey what do I know, I've only been working in HR in this part of the world for a decade....\r\n\r\nIf you feel the review has a lot of vitriol, then reach out to someone who has left the company in less than a year and ask them why.

Too many chiefs and not enough indians to execute their vacillating wishes. Probably this could be blamed on having 4 major development centers around the world, each competing for resources and duplicating some efforts, but the failure to succeed in the US, one of the biggest and most competitive markets, where high value and quality at reasonable cost became unattainable. Dont' even mention low cost phones. Not possible for Sony Ericsson, Perhaps high end $700 smartphones, the final frontier, will keep the ship afloat a few (2-3?) more years...\r\n\r\nBut with the maintained lack of focus of developing for several platforms, using duplicated development which do not communicate with each other, it looks more desperate (read: same old, same old) approach than a serious comeback.

Sony's payscale is way below industry standards. Sometimes a difference of 50% is normal. \r\n * HR is meant for supporting staff in their operations. Here its a complete opposite. \r\n * Work environment is worst. They recruit people from low ranked colleges, most of them doesnt have enough skills to work in s/w domain. Their recruitment is only for support and testing. Even a Bsc can do so.\r\n *1 year of on-job training for a fresher is of no use. They lack mentoring in each and every phase.\r\n * Employee benefits are less compared to other companies. Only insurance and discounted products are of use. Charges for cab services are too high.  No subsidized food. Even after paying you cant get the quality, quantity and taste.  No work from home facility.\r\n * The company  has no faith on their recruitment. You cannot take even a stationary item (Stapler, Marker etc. ) all from yourself. It requires managers approval. The only TV at the cafeteria wont play Cricket matches. ! such things will irritate you. You can see cost cutting everywhere. Evening snacks timings are 6.30-6.35pm. Yes, they last 5 mins only.  LOL \r\n * Once you leave the company, and try to contact the HR for your final settlement, They will not respond untill you drop them 5-10 mails. Once it happened to me that I didnt get my notice period's last months salary. But my other frens who were serving the notice period did get it for full 2 months, every month. Further, The variable pay is not prorated for the employee who is leaving the organisation. Another cost cutting.  This shows the way that payroll people are doing their job. ! \r\n * Leaving process at sisc will leave you frustrated at the company. Even if your project work is completed and it doesnt require for you to serve 2 months of notice period. They wont relieve you before 2 months whatsoever. Even if the employee has some personal problems to deal with, they wont leave you. Because its a matter of billing for them. They dnt care about staff's personal views and plans. A Complete waste of time. What you get after working 2 years is complete despair and disappointment.\r\n * SISC is a Billing Machine. It works like this. Recruit any kind of  guy. Charge the innocent clients for them. Pay very less to your staff and keep all the money in your pocket. ! New people will come after seeing sony's brand name . So, they are not short of applications any time. !\r\n * Appraisal process is amazing here. ! Yeah, its really is. The manager who meets you not even once a month, and who is heading a team of 40 people does your appraisal. Manager doesnt know the amount  and quality of work you have done, he doesnt knw what issues you have encountered and you have solved. Further, You are not involved in your managers appraisal. There is no kind of feedback loop whatsoever.  \r\n * For a fresher, there is a service agreement for 2 years.

She left and they appointed a real flake into her role. There has been an almost yearly turnover in executives running the Product Business Unit - the group responsible for making phones - generally speaking it is almost always a Swedish national and they rotate in and out with regular frequency.  \r\n\r\nMainly, the most surprising thing is that the company does not invest in the US market.  Despite protests otherwise and long speeches by every executive that \"this is the year, we'll turn things around in the US\" they still only manage to bring 1-2 phones to this market and most often have major quality problems with those handsets.  We've heard that every year for the past 5 years.  They also invest nothing in marketing or branding except for some stange reason a sponsorship with the women's tennis program.  \r\n\r\nInternal politics are so thick you could cut them with a knife.
