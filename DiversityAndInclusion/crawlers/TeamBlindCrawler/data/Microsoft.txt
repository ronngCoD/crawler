Over the years I've have learned about sexual harassment cases, racial discrimination cases, etc that go on with just a slap on the wrist, and in some cases are even are followed by promotions.- Nice perks ($1200 for well being in 2021, free XBox Game Pass Ultimate, many discounts, etc)-Possible to rest & vest (if that is your thing)-If you are the political type, you can level-up every 2 years- There is a push to change company culture, but not 100% sure how successful it is below the surface.

Strong push back still for things not invented at Microsoft. People from Windows team permeates the company as a whole, and in my experience, even when smart, they tend to be narrow minded and have a culture of bullying and pushing back to get their way. Build system and coding practices are in line with what you would expect from 20-30 years ago. If you want to master how to abuse C/C++ macros, coupled spaghetti code, the latest fad on .NET (not compatible with the previous latest fad), passive-aggressive push-back techniques, and convoluted COM interfaces, this is the place to be! Elitist higher management. Some people (L68 and above I know) will literally not talk to you unless you are above certain level; the issue with this is that they are totally disconnected from what is going on, living in a little bubble of privilege and filtering out whatever they dislike. In many teams you can only grow if you suck up and/or be silent and comply. My experience is that many employees are lifers and play favorites. Many managers are in just to build their little empires. If you are in a team with a weak leadership chain and are a high achiever this plays against you, as they may see you as a threat, actively suppress you, and will promote mediocre and worse only.By the way, at a certain level you are competing with all your peers on the org on the same band, so there is stack ranking, and above L64 it becomes toxic and political very fast. Compensation does not depend on impact, you have to fight for every cent, and then only if you are about to leave team they will throw something at you. Most money is used to make L67+ happy. Paying a big bonus for a DE/Partner can screw refreshers for everybody under their leadership for the year regardless of what you manager promised you (hint: middle manager can only do some damage control, they are not really empowered in this).Training is a joke for a company this size. Professional growth is totally up to you, and next to nil for management. You get some random subscriptions and good luck. Mentorship is flaky at best.No proper CI/CD anywhere I have seen. Pushing a change, depending on the team can literally take hours or days (if there is a conflict). Testing is as bad or worse as code, and looked down by most devs. At the end, before releasing, all this causes an incredible amount of manual labor for the most trivial tasks. Oncall for some teams takes most of the team effort because of this.Promotions are political, so the above keeps compounding over time until (periodically) a reorg is needed, and some within management are moved around (of course, without any external consequence or visible accountability).

To be fair, comp is ok, if considering all the tech companies (numerous startups included) across the country. However, the comp is not competitive in the tech talent places like Bay and Seattle.

Meanwhile companies like F/G provide free food, Microsoft just added 10% food prices by not subsidizing the sales tax last year. Search in the internal Yammer threads, you can find lots of frustrations on comp and benefits.2. Slow promo. Microsoft leveling is messed up, it basically divides each level into two sub-levels at least. This for sure will make promo slower. Also the slow process at Microsoft makes it even worse.3. Proprietary tech stack. To be fair, this is improving, especially in Azure. However you can still see lots of old-time Microsoft people are obsessed with Microsoft proprietary stack. The result is when they publicize the stack, it can be beaten brutally. Azure data lake gen1 was a good example.4. Too PM-centric. If you have to work with a TPM who's not from engineering background, good luck! It can be a real pain to work effectively. However it seems like a good number of TPMs are actually from Sales/marketing/MBA background!5. Easy to loss motives. If you are not strongly motivated, but you are concerned about your comp, you can easily trap yourself into a vicious cycle of wanting to leap forward, but you somehow lose last mile of momentum. I had good number of leet buddies in Microsoft, and we spent lots of quality time to study. But guess what, only I left so far.6. Talent drain with senior or below engineers. Couple years back, Microsoft can still easily poach candidates from Amazon for senior or below engineers. However ever since even Amazon ramped up on the industry hire comp, Microsoft just keeps lowering its posture. There's even one instance in Blind, where people choose Nordstrom over Microsoft!7. Senior software engineer title recognition problem. There's a general perception that Microsoft L63 does not usually map to senior at FAANG tier companies, although it usually depends on interview performance. Coupled with slow promo, it's almost wise to leave at the sweetspot levels, which is L60 and L62. Another wise spot is to leave within one year of new grad, since you can still be considered a new grad candidate for some companies like Google.8. At most a 4-year stop shop, if you care about TC. Microsoft also has the secret cult of insultingly low annual stock refresh. A quick blind search will make you realize, target stock refresh for L65 is ONLY 36k/5yr. Once you run out of on-hire cash and stock, your TC will cliff miserably, not even on par with your first year, even if you exclude on-hire cash. This is in stark contrast with F/G like companies, where  5th year TC is at least comparable to 1st year TC, if you don't count on-hire cash.", "resignation reason": "Pretty much all the cons above made me leave promptly.", "authorInfo": "Verified User Former Employee  z*****  Software Engineer - May 15, 2020"}
{"rating": "2.0", "desc": "Generally good work life balance, but it is team dependent. Comp is low, and the senior leadership is fake.", "pros": "Decent work life balance if you land in a non SaaS or PaaS team. Compensation is ok, and the medical plan is really good.401k match is excellent and there is an opportunity for higher contributions through backdoor Roth IRA.The campus is very nice and big, with new buildings coming soon.", "cons": "The senior leadership is very hypocritical and is only interested in PR stunts and not in fixing the root cause of issues (whether they are internal or external). Satya pretends to be a nice guy but in reality he is not very good at being empathetic towards Microsoft's employees. This trait seems to be common across the people on the board.Work life balance can easily get out of whack in teams which are part of SaaS or PaaS (e.g. Yammer, Azure, Outlook, etc.) with on-call rotations made difficult by the lack of engineers and too many buggy features.The constant request from clients to introduce new feature means tech debt is never address filling the code with bugs and making everyone's life more difficult. This is a sweatshop and pretty much a consulting business.Compensation is not competitive with Microsoft's main competitors, and in spite of the STL knowing about the comp issues, as people have been complaining about it yearly, they are refusing to address it.The talent is generally pretty mediocre, with a good number of engineers lacking basic knowledge about distributed systems, designing APIs and data encapsulation.", "resignation reason": "", "authorInfo": "Verified User Current Employee  b*******  Senior Software Engineer - May 14, 2020"}
