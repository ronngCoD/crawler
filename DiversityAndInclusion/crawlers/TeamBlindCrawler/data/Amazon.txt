{"rating": "4.0", "desc": "Great place to grow professionally and personally", "pros": "I am in the finance function and have worked at Amazon for four years, rotated three teams, currently at AWS. I generally enjoy Amazon's innovative culture, appreciate my smart colleagues, and the opportunity and growth it has given me.Career Growth - Career growth is probably the biggest pro working at Amazon. If you are hard working and can deliver results, you will get promoted fast. This is my 4th year working here. My first promotion is at 2.5-year mark and my manager is now working on my next promo doc. Myself started as an IC and now have a team of three. I've promoted one of my own team member and now I am writing a promo doc for a 2nd team member. I am considered being promoted at a pretty normal pace. I see capable people get promoted 3 times within 5 years.  I worked in the public sector pre-MBA and Amazon is the first tech firm/large private company I work for in my life. Recruiters reach out to me all the time on Linkedin. I am ready to try out other companies and I like that I have a wide range of options.  Compensation - Compensation is decent, although finance and business folks don't get paid as generous as engineers. When I graduated from business school and came to Seattle four years ago, my net worth was negative mainly due to the student loan. Now that I not only paid off my student loan, but also have decent savings, a house I can easily afford, and am about to buy a second place.  It certainly helps that Amazon stock value tripled from when I joined the company. Personal Growth - First thing is that you will be working with lots of smart people with great career experience. They help "raise the bar" for you and motive you. I've learn to work hard and work smart from my managers, my team, and my business partners. They inspire me to become a better self. Another thing is that you will get to learn some great "methods" here, such as starting with customers and "working backwards". The company makes sure to ingrain these "philosophy" into your daily work and becomes a habit, so that you don't lose focus of the big picture/end goal while completing detailed work. I find such methods beneficial to my personal life too.  Company Culture - I will talk about the cons of the company culture too. The biggest pro of Amazon's company culture is innovation. Even in the finance function, where we make fun of ourselves as "glorified accountants", we have team goals and individual goals to innovate our work process in order to make it faster, more accurate, and more scalable in order to better support the business. If you use the same process for a whole year without improvements you will get questioned why you didn't "invent and simplified". Improved/invented/simplified process is a must-have in your promo doc.  ", "cons": "Work Life Balance - WLB in the finance function is no good. Amazon loves "planning" and we have 3 planning (budgeting) cycles each year that occupy ~9 months. This means you only have ~3 months each year to take vacation and get the big projects done. During the planning cycles, I easily work 10 to 12 hours per day and often have to work several hours to one day per weekend. Last week my manager called me and two other teammates at 9:30PM to work thru an issue. We hung up the phone before 11pm and 2nd morning resumed work at 8am. There are constant rework and revision on the planning models/docs due to multiple levels of leadership reviews and business decision back-and-forth. This type of intensity and unnecessary churns make people frustrated and often is the reason they leave the team/company. Company Culture - What I don't appreciate is the so-called "frugality". I am not talking about free lunch or free beer. I don't care about these marginal benefits. My problem is specifically - the company doesn't give enough headcount or resources to the finance function. It is not un-common that one finance person supports a business with multi-billion dollar revenue and hundreds of business + SDE headcounts. And you own everything from monthly/quarterly financial reviews, operational budget approvals, headcount planning, pricing strategy, plus three planning cycles and planning doc writing. On top of that you have to do bunch of non-strategic, non-value add administrative type of jobs such as monitoring several idiotic finance systems that make data mistakes all the time, battling with the system teams, and correcting the data errors; being a finance data monkey for your business team and pulling data from messy databases etc. This is why folks in finance rotate much more frequently than business or engineer teams, which adds churns on knowledge transfer and team stability. This is also the root cause of why WLB is bad for finance teams, especially at AWS.

That could make you a target when managers want someone gone/PIPu2019d to hit their quota. And theyu2019d do it to those who have RSUs ready to be vested (when you hit 1 year or 2 and every 6 months after that.) If they fire you, they can claw back the non-vested RSU offered to you.People say itu2019s easy to switch team internally, yes to an extend. But if your team wants you gone or just arenu2019t happy with you, donu2019t even wish for a chance to rotate teams. Many of us sucked up our bossesu2019s dick for a year or two with no life left may not even get to switch successfully.Iu2019ve seen a lot of horrifying things happen to people at Amazon that I wouldnu2019t wish for anybody.Amazon doesnu2019t like to increase you much on base and sign on. Your recruiter would probably say I can give you couple of more shares in total. They might even tell you that youu2019re almost capped/at high of the band.The way Amazon works is they give you high on stocks, and if you want to keep the same sign on or increase your base, youu2019ll have to work your ass off and try to switch teams and negotiate a new offer. On avg people change roles every 1.5-2 years. And if you didnu2019t want to stay at Amazon anymore or if your leadership doesnu2019t love you or if theyu2019re shitty, theyu2019ll prevent you from rotating, then youu2019re stuck with no bonus or laid off. Then again, you lose all the non-vested shares.One should really assess their offer without the RSUs and ask themselves, would I still be happy for that 1-2 years if I werenu2019t going to get the RSUs after all?Thatu2019s also one way they do to trap you in and burn you out ud83dudd25 because no matter how shitty they treat you, people are gonna suck up until stock vested.Those who love themselves more would just move on from the company.There are a few notorious teams with high turnover and high short handed vacancies. They might even pay a little extra to you with saved dollars from those empty roles that youu2019ll be taking on.

I can certainly understand the sentiment behind how beggars canu2019t be choosers. But, please consider the reality and fact that, in todayu2019s time and age: 1) Amazon is no longer considered a real FAANG company like the way it was back in the day. Amazonu2019s notoriously toxic and truly abusive culture, its extremely unreasonable work demands, the aggressive and relentless PIP process, the rampant hypocrisy and toxic politics, coupled with the clear decline in talent over the years (no talented and strong engineer would never consider staying for longer than 1 year), the atrociously high attrition rate (I guess this is expected given the gigantic mass talent exodus + everyone and their moms, dads, sisters, friends, uncles, neighbors, and grandparents are getting PIPed left and right every dayu2014 check out their stupid URA quota) every day ud83dude02 = very few ppl actually left to do the work). Oh, Amazon is also having an extremely difficult time hiring any talent (bc of their extremely poor reputation world-wide), so any team you join will likely be super under-resources.

Amazonians genuinely donu2019t understand what that means. So, you WILL be working 996 hours, many times working 12 hour days consistently for weeks too. u2022 You will be evaluated in every way possible at every moment. Watch how you breathe, walk, talk, take a shit. Everything is watched. Itu2019s truly a 1984/North Korea-like atmosphere. Trust no one here. Be on guard all the time, 24/7. Assume that ppl will always screw you over for their own gain, because they will. Multiple times. Itu2019s really not personal. The culture is just a dog-eat-dog world of extreme Hunger Games. So screw people over or you will be screwed over. u2022 Your health and well-being, from your physical body to your sleep to your mental health, WILL be negatively affected. You wonu2019t have time to work out or prepare healthy food bc of the heavy workload. Threats of PIP and the constant hypervigilance of suspecting everyone is out to get you (bc they are) and the constantly need to be on guard + the exhausting politics games and kissing ass game will stress you to a level you have never felt before. You will maybe need some psychiatric help and medications. No shame in this bc a lot of ppl after starting Amazon have needed to resort to taking meds in order to handle the shit that is Amazon. Also, I am being sincere hereu2014 please try to find a good mental health/licensed therapist. You will definitely need to seek their service in the future. u2022 Oh also, ud83eudd5c and ud83cudf4c for payment.  Bc they do not see you as an actual human.

I am just not even close to having any of the traits that Amazon values. And I donu2019t ever want to invariably develop ANY of these traits or accidentally mistreat others in any of the atrocious ways like the Amazonians I work with. Oh, and I also think that having to take medications and undergo therapy (something that has never happened to any of us before until we got to Amazon) just to somehow cope and survive in an extremely toxic environment is ud83dudcafnot worth it.

AWS is cited as OPS heavy but in reality, an AWS team gets there post-launch.

Such a launch brings in a few promotions (including management promotions) and attrition to the unpromoted original members. The replacement hires have to deal with the operations and hence the OPS heavy tag. Alexa is lead by an L10 scientist and L4s are expected to pick up the speech and text processing jargons. Engineering work is influenced by Science work and science work is influenced by the leading scientists. So lots of Data engineering, ML infra (not ML itself), platform engg opportunities.

Truly, your work/life balance will go out the window, expectations are unclear, goals are basically made up/unattainable, and youu2019re at risk for being put on a performance plan for virtually no reason. I HATE the stack ranking that goes on, itu2019s the most unfortunate way to evaluate your people. Basically, each year managers have to rank their employees. Thereu2019s a top 10%, a bottom 10% and a middle 80%. If youu2019re in the bottom, you are put on a plan, which means you have the option to work towards improving and getting off of the plan, or Amazon will literally PAY you to leave. I have known people who are top performers on their team in terms of hitting their goals, but have still been put on a plan because they werenu2019t doing enough side projects in comparison to their peers. However, their managers did not at any point inform them that they needed to be doing more projects, and not once are managers held accountable for being a good manager and informing their employees. This dog eat dog culture is so unhealthy and toxic. The pay is also a huge con. After your 4 years, itu2019s almost pointless to stay at Amazon unless you have been promoted at least twice in 4 years. I know people who have recently been hired on who are making way more than I am, at a level below me. The pay gaps are so wide, that itu2019s truly unfair that you could be doing so much more than a peer and they could be making at least $50-75k more than you. I wish they would level set at certain points so that if youu2019re a loyal employee that continues to get promoted, that your compensation is more fairly matched. Itu2019s almost like they donu2019t want people to stay, theyu2019d prefer to have that fresh meat, which is so ridiculous and insulting after pouring years of dedication into a company.

Amazon also says they are data driven yet I don't see how things like their LPs are data-driven, and just seem to be made up and sound nice. Some more things to note. Amazon is a very office-oriented culture, so don't expect any permanent WFH, regardless of what the data says (imo, Amazon only cares about data when it suits them or when the data is undeniable or "neutral" data that doesn't challenge existing beliefs). Amazon's internal tools are relatively terrible.

Second issue is how political the company's senior leadership is (L8 and above) - if you can't play that game, then AMZN will be a challenge for you to be successful.

In 5 years I have had an org (department) completely collapse and my team "let go" - we all had 60 days to find another role. Luckily we did do that but it was horribly stressful. Another org I was in almost collapsed so I switched roles voluntarily before the ship sank. Now I got one of the many toxic leaders that Amazon seems to foster. I was lucky before but not now. He is setting me up to fail and trying to push me out of Amazon. The system allows (even encourages) managers to do that to whomever they want. When I started in 2016 I worked with some great people. Of that team, now, 4 of them have been pushed out (Pivot it's called) and 2 left Amazon without being pushed out (because they were going to be or got fed up with the toxic culture). Of that original team, I am one of only 2 left at the company. The average stay is 1.9 years for a reason. If you're smart, come to Amazon for 2 years and leverage that name on the resume to work somewhere that humans are respected. I am at the 5 year mark and only a week from likely getting pushed out like so many I know. They advertise that they are hiring in Seattle while quietly pushing out loads of people. When you leave, you get a modest severance and have to sign something saying you will not talk about it publicly or you'll get sued.  I can talk now because I have not signed it yet.  I'm not saying don't work for Amazon - I'm just saying know what you're getting into. It is not a sustainable job. Not healthy at all. But a good stepping stone early in one's career.

These two just wouldn't let me do my job (I am PMT) and treated me like trash. They wouldn't let me the grooming by saying the SDEs spend a lot of time "wasting" in grooming session. When I suggest a feature solution, the SDE3 will propose something else and not listen to my suggestions at all. The SDM will blindly go with what the SDE3 is saying, even if the customer has said they don't want it. They indulge in group ragging me and other junior SDEs during daily scrum. I could go on and on. I told my boss all of this, and he said I should improve on my "leadership skills" instead of "blaming others". He even went to the extent of siding by those assholes, despite being MY manager, saying they are good guys and I can't stay in his team if I don't stop complaining (read "blaming") about them. My boss even said that I shouldn't obsess with the customers because they 'don't know what they want".The SDEs in my team were complete jerks, except for 1 or 2. I can't believe that there can be so many jerks in one team. I went through anxiety and depression after a month, lost 6 kg and went to consult a psychriatist and counselor.

Using the salary, I paid off a major chunk of my education loan and now I can peacefully switch to another job, despite the covid situation. No job is worth your mental and physical wellbeing. Let me reiterate the true meaning of the leadership principles based on my experience:-Customer obsession (don't care about the customer)- Ownership (take the blame for all things done wrong by others)- Invent and simplify (create stupid solutions which causes bigger problems)- Are right a lot (you can't disagree with your managers or other higher levels if they are wrong)- Learn and be curious (poke nose into other people's business and try to own them)- Hire and develop the best (they mean the best assholes)- Insist on highest standards (find a way to find faults where none exists)- Think Big (when it comes to seeking glory for work done by others)- Bias for action (jump to wrong conclusions without any research and start working on it)- Frugality (be cheap, whenever possible)- Earn trust (indulge in people pleasing, without which you can't grow)- Deep dive (Be so detail oriented that you miss forest for the trees)- Have backbone; disagree and commit (debate and argue on proposals until they back down and give up)- Deliver results (at the cost of employee's wellbeing)", "cons": "- You will apply for L6 and get hired as L5 citing 'previous work experience' as a IC (even though the L6 role is IC)- Your level is opening displayed in phonetool so that your engineers can discriminate your inputs just because you are a level lower than them.- Extremely hostile, competitive and cut throat environment.- Your manager will abuse the leadership principles by trying to make you improve on them or even try putting you in PIP using it.- Gossiping, petty politics and insulting behaviors are rampant and will make your life hell", "resignation reason": "", "authorInfo": "Verified User Current Employee  M********  Product Manager - Oct 3, 2020"}

Toxic culture due to severe nepotismDuring my time there, a few girls and guys from a certain south Asian county tend to backstab other coworkers. They would report to the manager hastily whenever you make a small, trivial, harmless mistakes in the name of Amazon's leadership principles. They also complain and talk bad things about other coworkers a lots to the manager. Sadly the manager was on their side because they were from the same background. When it's a time to pick people for dev/pip, the manager use those examples they've been collected, twist them so that it would be a case for failing LPs, and throw hardworking and delivering guys under the bus. Apparently, they use LPs as their political weapons.2. Incompetent managementDuring my time there, projects were constantly reprioritized and cancelled. The manager would NOT blame himself for failing the lead, but rather he would blame you for not executing the project fast enough, thus resulting in project cancellation. What a joke. Sadly in Amazon, the manager is given too much power without countermeasure. They can fail the LPs, and still get away from it. They can be incompetent, and just drive around aimlessly. But you as a L4/L5 engineer would be the scapegoat for all the mess not created by you.3. Terrible WLBMany engineers were on Chime even after 9, 10 pm. Oncall was also terrible, which would page you 3-5 times in the middle of night (2, 3 am) in a week.

It doesnu2019t matter if the data is correct, if you donu2019t frame it in the pattern they want, you will be called out and told you arenu2019t meeting the bar for your job. Although there are countless areas to improve, youu2019ll be so buried with working on inherited goals and projects (tech debt and predetermined futures by management) that youu2019ll rarely have an opportunity to innovate on behalf of the customer experience. You have to be politically savvy to have influence. This means being manipulative among all the other responsibilities you must execute to perfection. Engineers are allowed to get away with acting like children, lashing out at peers in meetings, being overly emotional, and unproductive. Itu2019s your job to tell them to check their attitudes although you donu2019t manage them. They expect you to act as their assistant in scheduling every meeting they need and if you donu2019t theyu2019ll report to your manager that you arenu2019t fulfilling your role because you arenu2019t pulling the right people and communication together. Therefore, youu2019re expected to tag team every engineer on every deliverable theyu2019re assigned until every task is defined. Thatu2019s one person splitting effort across 7 engineeru2019s work, plus reporting to management, plus the role of facilitating strategy and planning for all of that work. Even things you clarify and plan correctly, if an engineer doesnu2019t listen or understand then doesnu2019t meet the criteria of the deliverable, youu2019ll be found responsible for not ensuring they understood. This means you must monitor every change in the system to measure that is was implemented correctly. You are expected to know how to be an engineer. That means low level nuts and bolts. You need to know how to build the environment in the same way an engineer does or else you will fall short from meeting expectations from both management and engineers. Iu2019m talking details about algorithms, coding languages and best practices, and how to configure monitoring for latency, host metrics, availability, etc.... plus run the day to day operations to ensure the right alarms are triggered and the engineer remediates them correctly. In addition to juggling day to day engineering development, operations, and driving continuous improvement, youu2019re also expected to write narratives for new products. These narratives are expected to use easy terms to explain complex technology to someone who knows nothing about it, yet need to meet expectations for principal engineers and management to buy in on the benefits for the organization. Iu2019ve seen countless people flail trying to nail this. Whatu2019s funny is the narratives that were approved by management were written by them, and they donu2019t explain the benefits well to new people coming in.

Rampant politics- Constant reorg for the sake of certain managers who want to collect more power and grow his career.4. Nepotism in hiring and promotion- Incompetent and unqualified people are hired and promoted because they are from the same country as the hiring managers (A south Asian country that exports many IT guys).5. Poor management- Managers are incompetent in my org. Projects are constantly reprioritized and cancelled due to their failure in leadership.

Coming from the startup world (having been an IC and an engineering leader), I have generally found that the kinds of aspirational, political managers who get in the way of others and only serve to make the company less efficient are relatively easy to find and push out. This, as I would rudely be awakened to, was not the case here. I was blown away by how low the bar was for SDMs here and how accepted that was. My manager and skip level manager were deeply ineffective at their jobs. A list of their shortcomings:- Poor communication skills- Poor writing skills- Nonexistent engineer onboarding- Ticket/engineer allocation by random walk- Preference for empire building (extraneous top heavy SDM hierarchies)- Nonexistent customer centricity (lagging product adoption KPIs years after launch)- Weak product skills- Nonexistent business instincts- Prone to outbursts of anger- Fragile ego - Tendency to retaliate, hold grudges- Tendency to chew others out in public- Preference for conflict/blame over dispassionate root cause analysis and reflection- Tendency to react defensively to feedback by reflecting it back on the speaker w/ chilling effects - Interpersonal constraints/unlikeable- Difficulty earning trust from reports- Difficulty earning trust from sister teams- Difficulty getting engineers promoted- Difficulty with organizational thinking- Poor active listening skills- Poor self awareness- Difficulty retaining talent- Tendancy to take credit for engineer sourced ideas- Inability to conceive of team responsibility- Tendency to conflate team responsibility with individual responsibility- Tendency to push team weaknesses onto individuals- Lack of experience at strong engineering led startups and/or big companiesI eventually received an offer from another team, one vetted by a close friend who could personally vouch for my new manager. But unfortunately, I think the damage had already been done. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, an atrocious first impression of what itu2019s like to work here. One that is obviously not unique, and maybe even a known quantity -- the NYT exposu00e9 about Amazon was remarkable for how little it surprised anyone. The lack of onboarding, the seemingly naive tolerance for attrition, and the childishly political antics of my old managers (from dinging me to my new manager to trying to manipulatively "teach lessons" to reports when angered for objectively inconsequential reasons) really had me questioning whether I wanted to work here at this point in my career. I got an even better opportunity elsewhere, so I left.As one of my mentors told me, "In order for a company to stay running at that size, you have to run things in such a way that even an idiot can be a middle manager" -- I believe he is right and that is a well known, common sense statement to make about big companies. But it's one thing to talk about it in the abstract and another thing entirely to see it in person. I wonder if the very things that made my experience miserable (apathy, lack of consequences for poor leadership, lack of onboarding support, lack of minimum bar from business unit to business unit, leeway for management to have enough rope to hang themselves) are inextricably tied to the very things that make it a great place to be as a senior leader (lots of freedom to innovate, ability to run a business unit with minimal bureaucratic oversight beyond yearly fundraising protocols, gigantic distribution channels and access to customers, huge network effects and tailwinds). Would I even return here one day, just later on in my career? You need the ability to diplomatically handle idiots in middle management to do that. Would I be better at doing that later on in my career, or would I have an even lower tolerance to put up with this kind of a waste of my very finite remaining years of life? Who knows. My guess is the latter.Would I recommend this company to others? To be honest, my experience is mixed. I found my experience valuable and very informative, even if it was deeply unpleasant and not necessarily something I'd want to repeat. But I think that if I had started on the new team that gave me the offer, Iu2019d probably have a very different impression and be writing a different review. Sometimes, thatu2019s just the way things work out. Amazon has a very specific kind of core culture, and a wide range of variation between business units and their culture, and even more variation between managers responsible for teams inside those units. I suppose it is fitting then that just as you must watch out for counterfeits and unscrupulous vendors with the core marketplace product, so too must you do the same with your career here.

Great environment to build some professional maturity, develop an ability to think holistically about the customer, the business and the tech to find and deliver solutions that are truly valuable. Spending 3-4 years at Amazon during your early or mid-career is likely going to do more for your professional development than anything else you could do, IFF you are lucky enough to find a somewhat stable team and leadership, which leads us into the cons...", "cons": "The company has *zero* standards for producing, training, and holding managers and leaders accountable for the culture and practices they create within their team. Becoming a people manager at Amazon is purely a political reward (in more stable orgs) or a pragmatic necessity (in fast-growing teams). Little or no thought is given to the person's suitability to lead, inspire, or set a vision, and little to no support and mentorship are given to those transitioning. Leaders at Amazon have the leeway to interpret and enforce the company's mechanisms such as LPs, hiring and promotion guidelines however they see fit, with HR often being highly ineffective at containing bad practices, even mildly smart people can find arguments to twist company guidelines to let them do what they want. The company has no effective calibration controls in place to ensure that line managers aren't abusing, twisting, or outright ignoring the company's ideals.This leads to environments where, for example, you may have a VP who's been with the company a while and perhaps even has good intentions, a team of directors who are great at looking selectively for data points that bolster the narrative they want to surface up to their leadership and ignoring everything else, and a layer of line managers underneath them that are running rampant and can pretty much do whatever they want so long as they provide at least some useful results for their leaders. In other words, a complete wild west culture with ignorance at the top, sycophancy in the middle and sociopathy below.  And then there's the peons, your average L4, L5 and L6 workers. these folks make up I would guess 80% of the company's white collar workforce. You'll be left to your own devices, to fend for yourself and survive however you can. To this end, the company makes it reasonably easy to move around -- but sufficiently smart and sociopathic line managers have ways to block that, too. if you can survive long enough and fight, backstab and claw your way to the bottom of the management ladder, perhaps you, too, will have the opportunity to rule your own little fiefdom how you see fit.

At companies like Microsoft, you get $10k a year to pursue a graduate degree.Employees have to pay health insurance premiums instead of having them covered by the employer.No free food/drinks/snacks.Management does not lead by example. Decisions come top-down and decision making is very hierarchical.You rarely ever see ICs with tenure over 10 years here because the ones who stay have no better options like visa restrictions, canu2019t get a better job elsewhere, or are masochists.Poor teamwork because you compete against your teammates to not get PIPed.Inconsistent hiring bar. Some teams you have superstars where people come from top universities and well-regarded companies and have impressive achievements under their names. Others are in desperate need of headcount and hire whomever they want to fill the role. Mediocre new hires are acceptable on those teams because the work is not very important or interesting enough. The SDE intern hiring bar is pretty low. You pass an online assessment (which people definitely cheat on because answers are online) and one virtual chat, and you get the job!A good number of teams own legacy systems, so most engineers waste their careers on those teams doing operational work. They typically donu2019t raise the bar on engineering and simply hire warm bodies to maintain existing systems.You also have the privilege of working with non-tech product managers at a tech company, which means they are effectively useless when the customers for the project youu2019re working on are developers.", "resignation reason": "", "authorInfo": "Verified User Current Employee  u*****  Software Engineer III - Jul 25, 2020"}
