Your success at Microsoft, while largely up to you, is also VERY much bound to the group you're working in.  For example, the Windows group periodically turns into a dumpster fire where it must certainly be the worst place on Earth to work.  Layoff's, lack of promotions, terrible work-life balance, etc... then the re-org comes, people get jumbled around, new people get hired and things stabilize for a year or two.  Then decay starts and the process repeats.  I've had 20 years to observe the cyclical nature of hire & fire at Microsoft, and there was also a time when I myself subscribed to 70 hour work week...but I wasn't rewarded for that additional effort, and in those 20 years I can honestly say that it's entirely up to you to manage your work-life balance, and pull yourself out of unsavory situations.  There's so many groups to work in at Microsoft that it can be detrimental to your soul and your career to stay parked in once place too long.  15 years in Windows was about 13 years too long, and I definitely have regrets.  The benefits have gone down-hill over the years, some of that was courtesy of ObamaCare.  Prior to Obama, Microsoft's Healthcare was absolutely top-notch.  Now, it's good but not anywhere near as great as it once was.  Same for the company store benefits... they used to be spectacular, now they're mediocre.

Someone (or several people) must fall into the bottom bucket. Those folks get a bad review.
