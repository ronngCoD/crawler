With 2020 happening (you know what I mean) combined with the instability of the job market, it just made sense to join the company and work my way up while I still have the energy to do so! I wanted to wait at least a month before putting in a review, so I could make sure that the rose colored glasses were completely faded, so here is my honest review - at least for my location in Oak Cliff (DAL3). The GOOD:The people are great here! Management truly listens, and really wants to make this a great experience for you. Be up front with them - if you aren't feeling well (ie: your feet are killing you), let your lead know - you aren't wimping out, they all understand as they've all been there! Go home, no one will look at you differently. Every associate is equal, and in the month I have been here, I absolutely love it, everyone there treats everyone else with respect! Oh, and the benefits... OUTSTANDING! Day One health insurance coverage with multiple plans? Stock options? Prepaid legal? Where else can you find this??? There is room for advancement, but be prepared to pay your dues. Remember, even going in as a Fulfillment Associate, your job matters (YOU matter)... without the FA, how else are the orders going out? They recognize this.  :) The company takes care of us.

I do think Amazon should have a few yearly events to boost employee moral such as BBQs, party's and sports events such as warehouse vs warehouse basketball games or something. Amazon bad rep is somewhat unfair I think some workers want to punch the clock and go to the club afterwards this is definitely not the job for that if you are successful at this job there's a good chance you will wind up in a need for a shower and probably just want to stay in afterwards.

From there I was assigned to Stationary PS to document and resolve situations that take a lot longer to process due to their complications.

{"rating": "5.0", "desc": "A typical day at Amazon is pretty basic depending on the day or holiday. On a regular day, there's not much going on but employees working on their assignments and if there's a new hire event then you'll see Hr giving the new hire employees a tour of the workplace.\rWhat I've learned working with Amazon is that on a busy day you have to stay focused and get your work done being that some orders have to be out at a specific time. Now, on a basic day, you don't have to do too much as if you would on a busy day but you'd still have to keep the same pace so that you can get your scores in. Amazon goes based on your performance by how many scores you're putting in on your work shift. \rIf you want a good name I would suggest keeping your scores high consistently. Around holidays Amazon is the BEST place to be not only for employees who score high,  veteran employees or new hire employees but for everyone! In my opinion, because there are so many good offers around the holidays for Amazon employees. \rOffers like overtime, extra pay, gifts and so much more! It's really a good time for employees who score high so make sure that you're getting those good scores in!\rThe hardest part, well there's really not any hard task working at Amazon but you do have to make sure that you're focused so that you don't get your orders confused and making sure that you're scanning the right codes. Don't have your items all over the place and make sure that you're neat as well.

Very consistent, very mundane, and very easy.
